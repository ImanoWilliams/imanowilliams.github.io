### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-user" aria-hidden="true"> </i> About me
I am a fourth year PhD Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ncat.edu/coe/departments/cs/index.php) at [North Carolina A&T State University](https://www.ncat.edu/). I obtained my MS in Computer Science at North Carolina A&T State University in 2015 and my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Electronics at The University of The West Indies at [Mona Campus](https://www.mona.uwi.edu/) in 2012.

**I will complete my Ph.D. in Computer Science in Fall 2020.**

Currently, I am a graduate researcher in the Information Assurance Lab directed by Professor Xiaohong Yuan. My research focuses on building tools for automated software secure engineering by utilizing natural language processing, recommendation system, and application ontology.

### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-book-reader" aria-hidden="true"> </i> Research Interest
My main goal is to improve secure software engineering by focusing on:
  * **Automated Software Engineering: ** Automated Vulnerability Localization in Software Artifacts
  * **Natural Language Processing in Software Engineering: ** Extraction of Domain Features in Software Artifacts
  * **Ontology in Software Engineering: ** Model Based Consistency Checking, and Model Based Software development
  * **User Studies in Automated Software Engineering Tools: ** Situational Characteristics, Personal Characteristics, User Experience, User Interaction
